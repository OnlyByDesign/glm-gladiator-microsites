        <h2>How Much Money Is Paid in an Indiana Workers’ Compensation Claim?</h2>
        <div class="spacer-bar"></div>
        <p>Payment in workers’ compensation typically includes two-thirds of a worker’s wages if they are unable to work, in addition to all medical expenses related to the injury, including hospital bills, prescription drug costs, rehabilitation and repayment for costs of travel to and from medical facilities.</p>
        <p>There are several factors that might determine how much an employee will receive. For example, if an employee is still able to work, they might be given a role that doesn’t require the same physical demands as the role they had prior to their injury. If that new role means less pay, they can still be paid partial benefits.</p>
        <h3 class="content-left push-t">What Makes a Good Workers’ Compensation Attorney?</h3>
        <p>A good workers’ compensation attorney will know Indiana’s workers’ compensation laws inside and out. They will be fierce advocates for their clients and provide aggressive legal representation. If you’re looking for a Columbus, Indiana workers’ compensation attorney, ask them about their track record. An experienced attorney has encountered many different types of cases, and there is little that will surprise them.</p>

        <h3 class="content-left no-push">Does an Injury Qualify for a Workers’ Compensation Claim in Indiana?</h3>
        <p><strong>When a worker is injured on the job, they are entitled to workers’ compensation benefits if…</strong></p>
        <ul class="nobullets">
            <li><p>They are employed by a business that carries workers’ compensation insurance.</p></li>
            <li><p>Their injuries weren’t caused by their own misconduct, such as drug use or alcohol impairment.</p></li>
            <li><p>The injury occurred while the employee was doing their job or was on the clock.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This last point comes with many exceptions and depends on the nature of the work. For example, if a worker is required to travel for their job, they might be injured in a vehicle crash and still be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits.</p>

    <p class="two-third content-left clearfloat"><strong>Indiana’s workers’ compensation requirements</strong> are similar to those in other states. Most employers are required to carry workers’ compensation insurance. Employees are covered from the first day on the job.

            <h3 class="content-left push-b">What Are Employees’ Obligations after Suffering a Workplace Injury?</h3>
            <p>Workers’ compensation covers employees from the first day on the job. Aside from instances of employee misconduct, an employee is entitled to compensation if their injury was suffered on the job. However, to make sure the process goes smoothly, <em>it is important that an employee notify their employer of the incident that led to the injury as soon as possible</em>. It is also important for an injured worker to seek medical treatment immediately.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="half">
            <h3 class="content-left push-b">What if an Employer Doesn’t Have Coverage?</h3>
            <p>If an employer doesn’t have workers’ compensation coverage, they are more vulnerable to injury-related lawsuits from workers. Workers might opt to file a personal injury claim to receive compensation for their injuries.</p>
            <p>If an employer denies coverage because they claim a worker is a contractor and not an employee, then the worker might seek to prove that have been misclassified and, thus, are entitled to benefits.</p>
