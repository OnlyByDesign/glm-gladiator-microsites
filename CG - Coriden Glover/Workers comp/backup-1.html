Thousands of Hoosiers suffer workplace injuries in Indiana every single year. Many of these injuries lead to worker's compensation claims and, in some cases, disputes between employers and their employees over benefits. At <a href="http://coriden.com/">Coriden Glover</a>, we have helped many of our clients resolve disputes over worker's compensation claims.
<h2>What Should Workers Do after Being Injured on the Job in Indiana?</h2>
If you’ve been injured on the job, you should…
<ul>
 	<li>Notify your supervisor as soon as possible, preferably in writing.</li>
 	<li>Seek immediate medical treatment.</li>
 	<li>Keep copies of everything related to the injury in the hours, days and weeks that follow.</li>
 	<li>Contact a Columbus, Indiana workers’ compensation lawyer if there is a dispute with the employer or insurance company.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Does an Injury Qualify for a Workers’ Compensation Claim in Indiana?</h2>
When a worker is injured on the job, they are entitled to workers’ compensation benefits if…
<ul>
 	<li>They are employed by a business that carries workers’ compensation insurance.</li>
 	<li>Their injuries weren’t caused by their own misconduct, such as drug use or alcohol impairment.</li>
 	<li>The injury occurred while the employee was doing their job or was on the clock.</li>
</ul>
This last point comes with many exceptions and depends on the nature of the work. For example, if a worker is required to travel for their job, they might be injured in a vehicle crash and still be entitled to workers’ compensation benefits.
<h2>How Much Money Is Paid in an Indiana Workers’ Compensation Claim?</h2>
Payment in workers’ compensation typically includes two-thirds of a worker’s wages if they are unable to work, in addition to all medical expenses related to the injury, including hospital bills, prescription drug costs, rehabilitation and repayment for costs of travel to and from medical facilities.

There are several factors that might determine how much an employee will receive. For example, if an employee is still able to work, they might be given a role that doesn’t require the same physical demands as the role they had prior to their injury. If that new role means less pay, they can still be paid partial benefits.
<h2>What Makes a Good Workers’ Compensation Attorney?</h2>
A good workers’ compensation attorney will know Indiana’s workers’ compensation laws inside and out. They will be fierce advocates for their clients and provide aggressive legal representation. If you’re looking for a Columbus, Indiana workers’ compensation attorney, ask them about their track record. An experienced attorney has encountered many different types of cases, and there is little that will surprise them.

<h2>What Expenses Are Covered in an Indiana Workers’ Compensation Claim?</h2>
Workers’ compensation benefits in Indiana include…
<ul>
 	<li>66.6 percent of an employee’s weekly wages – if the injury disables the worker and requires time off</li>
 	<li>Hospital bills</li>
 	<li>Ongoing care</li>
 	<li>Prescription medications</li>
 	<li>Mileage for the distance travelled to and from the doctor’s office.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Are Employees’ Obligations after Suffering a Workplace Injury?</h2>
Workers’ compensation covers employees from the first day on the job. Aside from instances of employee misconduct, an employee is entitled to compensation if their injury was suffered on the job. However, to make sure the process goes smoothly, <em>it is important that an employee notify their employer of the incident that led to the injury as soon as possible</em>. It is also important for an injured worker to seek medical treatment immediately.

If you are a worker who has suffered an injury and you’d like help with your claim, consider contacting a workers’ compensation attorney at Coriden Glover.
<h2>Does Fault Matter in Indiana Workers’ Compensation Claims?</h2>
Fault shouldn’t be a concern in a workers’ compensation claim except in instances involving misconduct. Workers’ compensation insurance is a no-fault program, which means it is designed to cover workers regardless of who was at fault. The Columbus, Indiana workers’ compensation attorneys at Coriden Glover provide legal representation to both employees and employers and provide consultation regarding options in a work injury case.
<h2>Should I Feel Bad about Taking Legal Action?</h2>
Employers and employees often have close working relationships, and it’s normal for either party to feel a sense of dread when imagining taking legal action against the other. However, it’s important to understand that legal action in workers’ compensation cases is simply about fairness. There’s nothing wrong with asking for fair treatment.

<h2>The Importance of Seeking Medical Treatment after a Workplace Injury</h2>
Workers who have been injured in an on-the-job accident need to seek immediate medical treatment. It’s vital that workers look after their health and avoid the possibility of worsening an injury. Seeking medical treatment also ensures that an injury is documented by a professional. This visit will be central to a workers’ compensation claim, if one is needed.
<h2>Getting Paid While Unable to Work</h2>
If you are disabled – either temporarily or permanently -- from your injury, workers’ compensation benefits will cover two-thirds of your wages while you are unable to work. While these benefits won’t heal injuries or cover your full wages, they will provide much-needed financial assistance while you wait for your injuries to heal.

<h2>What if an Employer Doesn’t Have Coverage?</h2>
If an employer doesn’t have workers’ compensation coverage, they are more vulnerable to injury-related lawsuits from workers. Workers might opt to file a personal injury claim to receive compensation for their injuries.

If an employer denies coverage because they claim a worker is a contractor and not an employee, then the worker might seek to prove that have been misclassified and, thus, are entitled to benefits.
<h2>Ask Our Workers’ Compensation Attorney What the Appeals Process Looks Like</h2>
The appeals process is more complicated than an initial claim.
