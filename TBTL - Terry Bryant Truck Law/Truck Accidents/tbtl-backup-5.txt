                              <p>Every year in the United States, tens of thousands of people die in motor vehicle accidents. About 1 in 10 highway deaths occur in crashes involving large trucks, according to the <a href="http://www.iihs.org/research/fatality_facts_2009/largetrucks.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> (IIHS).</p>

                              <p>Considering their much heavier weight and overall mass, it can take big rigs almost 720 feet, or about two football fields, to stop. This stopping distance is far greater than that of passenger vehicles. If conditions are rainy and streets are slick, or if a truck’s brakes are poorly maintained, the stopping distance will be even longer.</p>

                              <p>Passenger vehicles and motorcycles are greatly outweighed by trucks, putting them at a severe disadvantage in wrecks. A fully loaded tractor-trailer can weigh as much as 80,000 pounds. The average passenger car weighs in at around 4,000 pounds. The heaviest motorcycles top the scale at approximately 500 pounds. With these things in mind, it isn’t difficult to see why occupants of passenger vehicles and motorcycles are often on the losing end in accidents with trucks.</p>

                              <p>What are some of the factors that cause large truck accidents? Truck driver inexperience, driver fatigue (data from the IIHS shows that drivers behind the wheel for more than 8 hours are twice as likely to crash), and equipment defects, including failures of brakes, lighting, and steering, are some of the reasons for truck crashes. Drivers of passenger vehicles also contribute to these crashes.</p>

                        <p><strong>A truck accident attorney</strong> serves many functions for his or her client. They handle correspondence and paperwork so that the client can focus on their recovery and day-to-day activities. In cases involving large trucks, the process of filing a claim can be particularly time-consuming and daunting, because trucking accidents often involve companies that have their own legal teams. Hiring an attorney with experience in handling truck accident cases helps position your case for settlements that accurately reflect your needs.</p>

                              <p><strong>The statute of limitations</strong> refers to the amount of time you have to file an injury claim. In Texas, the statute of limitations is generally 2 years. (***ALWAYS CONSULT DIRECTLY WITH A LAWYER TO UNDERSTAND THE DEADLINES FOR YOUR POTENTIAL CLAIM.***)This is true not just of personal injury cases, but also for wrongful death and product liability cases, two case types that often stem from large truck accident cases.</p>

                              <p><strong>You’ve seen the word “negligence”</strong> mentioned several times in your search for an attorney. It’s worth understanding the basic principle behind this legal term. Negligence means carelessness, and it implies that someone failed to act in a reasonable, acceptable manner. For example, a truck driver who is sending a text message when they should be focused on driving would be considered negligent. A drunk or impaired truck driver would also be considered negligent.</p>

                        <h5 style="color:black;">When product liability causes accidents</h5>
                        <p>In some cases, human error is not to blame for a truck accident. If a trucker’s actions didn’t contribute to the wreck, but a faulty vehicle part did, there are still legal options for the injured person. The manufacturer could be held accountable if they made a defective vehicle component, or the trucking company could be held responsible if they failed to maintain their truck.</p>
                        <h5 style="color:black;">Where do truck accidents most often happen?</h5>
                        <p>Large truck crashes are more likely to occur on rural roads than urban ones. From 2014 to 2016, 60% of crashes involving large trucks occurred on rural roads, as opposed to 37.7% on urban roads. Large truck crashes are <a href="https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/safety/data-and-statistics/large-truck-and-bus-crash-facts-2016" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">most likely</a> during the day (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.), Monday through Friday. This is when traffic is at its peak.</p>
                        <p>While these statistics give us an indication of where and when these crashes are most likely, it’s important to remember that they can happen anywhere large trucks and passenger vehicles share the road.</p>

    <h2>Client Review</h2>
    <p>I was out of state in Houston, Texas and driving on a major highway in a Toyota Celica when a tractor trailer decided to change lanes and just didn’t see me. My car was lifted off the ground just enough that I lost control of the steering. It was terrifying. Several surgeries later, my life is back on track. I found Attorney Terry Bryant through a friend and he immediately made me feel like he would take care of everything. What I appreciated most is that Terry Bryant is not only – what I feel is the best personal injury attorney in Houston – but his team surrounds you and walks you through difficult situations like these with great compassion and empathy. Kudos to Gregg Anderson as well. Great lawyers. Great people. They really treat you like family.</p>
