DUI Charges in South Carolina from Joe Leventis
[/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_custom_heading text="SOUTH CAROLINA DUI – WHAT'S AT STAKE?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Why should you go through the effort of fighting a DUI charge? Isn't it just as easy to take the penalties and move on? In South Carolina, the penalties for DUI are quite stringent. For even just a first offense, you can spend up to 90 days in jail and have up to $1,000 in fines. Your license will be suspended for six months. If you have a subsequent DUI charge in the next 10 years, you face up to three years in prison and $6,500 in fines and a suspension of one year.

If your blood alcohol level is excessively high or someone is injured because of your driving, these penalizes can be even more severe.
Not only that, but when you are convicted of a DUI, you receive a mark on your record that will make getting a job or finding a place to live or new car insurance in the future more challenging. Refusing to take the test won't help either. Failing to take a blood alcohol test will lead to a suspension of up to six months, because South Carolina is an implied-consent state. This means that driving in South Carolina means you are consenting to blood alcohol testing if asked.

As you can see, these penalties have far-reaching implications, yet with the help of a South Carolina DUI attorney, you can fight these penalties and protect your future and your reputation. Contact the Leventis Law Firm right away if you have been pulled over for driving under the influence, because there is too much at risk to ignore these charges.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF A DUI?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]First, contact an attorney and don’t say anything you don’t have to say to authorities. Just like you’ve seen in film and television, anything you say can and will be used against you. Comply with the police and be respectful, but if you are placed under arrest, immediately tell the authorities that you want to call your attorney and wait for them before you do anything else.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="DUI TESTS" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]There are several different ways the authorities can test a driver’s impairment. Your breath, blood, urine and saliva can all be tested for substances ranging from alcohol to illegal drugs.

You can legally refuse to take a sobriety test, but the penalties you face will often be much harsher than they would be if you complied. A refusal does make proving intoxication more difficult, but your refusal can also be used against you in your prosecution.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="DUI LAWYER IN COLUMBIA SC " font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]If you've been charged with DUI, South Carolina DUI attorneys at Leventis Law Firm can help.

Remember, you have rights, and the Leventis Law Firm is here to help you fight for them.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="WHY YOU NEED A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]A DUI defense lawyer in Columbia, SC plays one of the most important roles in our criminal justice system. They are advocates for people who have been accused of a crime. They possess a deep knowledge of their state’s laws. Attorneys use their knowledge, skill and experience to make sure their client is treated fairly, and they look for opportunities to lessen or eliminate charges facing their client.

The legal system can be complicated and fraught with potential for self-incrimination. In other words, the actions you take and the words you say can do your case great harm. Attorneys not only build the best possible case for their clients, they help them avoid making costly mistakes.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="SHOULD I GET A PUBLIC DEFENDER?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Many public defenders are good attorneys. They provide a public service by representing people who have no other option for an attorney. However, public defenders often face heavy caseloads and have limited resources to devote to clients. This is why many people who face criminal charges choose to hire their own attorney. A good defense attorney sees their client as more than a case number, and they can devote more time, attention and effort to their client’s case.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="IS REPRESENTING YOURSELF AN OPTION?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Anyone can represent themselves in our legal system, but this is never recommended. Even the most skilled criminal defense attorney will hire another lawyer if they face criminal charges. It’s difficult for someone representing himself or herself to remain objective and maintain credibility in front of a judge and jury.

More importantly, the average citizen has a limited understanding of our laws and court system. It’s vital to seek legal representation as soon as you suspect that you will be facing criminal charges. An attorney can keep you informed about laws related to your situation and be proactive in handling the specific legal requirements of your case. Regardless of how intelligent or competent you are, don’t fall prey to the idea that you should be your own advocate in court.[/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image="4394" img_size="full" alignment="center" vc_none_hover_effect=""][vc_custom_heading text="WHAT MAKES A GOOD CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]A good criminal defense attorney is knowledgeable, assertive and experienced. It often takes years to build a successful legal practice, so it’s typically in a person’s best interest to seek an attorney who has a track record of success.

Look for an attorney who has the skill and resources to give your case the best possible chance of success. They will have a history of getting results for clients, and they’ll have access to expert witnesses that they can use on your behalf.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="PROSECUTOR’S STRATEGY" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Prosecutors are tasked with getting results, and that means getting convictions. Their incentive is to make the strongest case against the person accused of a crime. They paint a picture of the accused in a way that can sometimes make them seem dangerous and untrustworthy. Prosecutors use someone’s words and actions against them, using every opportunity to show them in a negative light.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="WHAT IS A FELONY?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]A felony is considered a more serious crime than a misdemeanor or a violation. People charged with felonies face the potential of more than a year in prison, in addition to large fines. The societal consequences of a felony are also greater than “lesser” charges, making it even more difficult to find a job, get an education or find adequate housing.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="WHAT IS A MISDEMEANOR?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Misdemeanors result in lighter penalties than felonies, though they still have major consequences in someone’s life. People convicted of a misdemeanor can face up to year in jail, in addition to steep fines.  Employment, housing, educational and financial consequences can also stem from misdemeanors.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="CONSEQUENCES OF A CONVICTION IN SOUTH CAROLINA" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]The most significant consequences of a criminal charge include imprisonment, probation and fines. Unfortunately, even after someone has “paid their dues,” they can still be judged unfairly by others and presented with several obstacles in life. A criminal record can make life very challenging. The job you’re seeking, the college you’re applying to, the apartment you want, the loan you need – these things can all be denied because of a criminal record.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Every citizen in the United States is guaranteed basic rights. You have the right to equal and fair treatment in our justice system. You have the right to remain silent when your statements can be used against you. You are protected against unreasonable searches and seizures of your property. Unfortunately, these rights can be violated, which is why the right to an attorney is one of the most important we have.

Your right to an attorney should be exercised as soon as you are arrested. Don’t answer any questions or say anything that you don’t have to say. Request an attorney immediately and let them make sure your rights are being protected.[/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image="4395" img_size="full" alignment="center" vc_none_hover_effect=""][vc_custom_heading text="HOW THE CRIMINAL COURT SYSTEM WORKS IN SOUTH CAROLINA" font_container="tag:h3|font_size:25px|text_align:left|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]South Carolina’s criminal court system, much like that of the rest of the nation, can be complicated and intimidating for someone who has never experienced it. After being arrested by law enforcement, a person is subjected to several different processes, which can include prosecution, indictment, pretrial hearings, trials, sentencing and appeals.

Along the way, there are opportunities and pitfalls that determine the outcome of a case. An attorney helps maximize opportunities for success and minimize pitfalls.
