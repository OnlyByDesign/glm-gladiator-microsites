Why should you go through the effort of fighting a DUI charge? Isn't it just as easy to take the penalties and move on? In South Carolina, the penalties for DUI are quite stringent. For even just a first offense, you can spend up to 90 days in jail and have up to $1,000 in fines. Your license will be suspended for six months. If you have a subsequent DUI charge in the next 10 years, you face up to three years in prison and $6,500 in fines and a suspension of one year.

[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="If your blood alcohol level is excessively high or someone is injured because of your driving, these penalizes can be even more severe." font_container="tag:h4|text_align:center" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Not only that, but when you are convicted of a DUI, you receive a mark on your record that will make getting a job or finding a place to live or new car insurance in the future more challenging. Refusing to take the test won't help either. Failing to take a blood alcohol test will lead to a suspension of up to six months, because South Carolina is an implied-consent state. This means that driving in South Carolina means you are consenting to blood alcohol testing if asked.

As you can see, these penalties have far-reaching implications, yet with the help of a South Carolina DUI attorney, you can fight these penalties and protect your future and your reputation. Contact the Leventis Law Firm right away if you have been pulled over for driving under the influence, because there is too much at risk to ignore these charges.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/6"][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row full_width="1" bg_style="img_parallax" overlay_row="yes" row_mask_bg="" row_arrow="" el_class="winning_section" css=".vc_custom_1551328665543{background-image: url(https://www.leventislaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/lawyer-1.jpg?id=4425) !important;background-position: center !important;background-repeat: no-repeat !important;background-size: cover !important;}" bd_p_speed="0.2" overlay_color="rgba(164,61,42,0.75)"][vc_column el_class="content-padding" css=".vc_custom_1551328301968{background-position: center !important;background-repeat: no-repeat !important;background-size: cover !important;}"][vc_custom_heading text="SOUTH CAROLINA DUI LAWS" font_container="tag:h3|text_align:center|color:%23ffffff" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_raw_html]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[/vc_raw_html][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row full_width="1" el_class="choose bg-white"][vc_column width="2/3" el_class="choose_lt content-padding"][vc_custom_heading text="WHAT SHOULD I DO AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF A DUI?" font_container="tag:h2|text_align:center|color:%23a43d2a" use_theme_fonts="yes" css=".vc_custom_1551325003899{padding-bottom: 25px !important;}"][vc_column_text]First, contact an attorney and don’t say anything you don’t have to say to authorities. Just like you’ve seen in film and television, anything you say can and will be used against you.

Your breath, blood, urine and saliva can all be tested for substances ranging from alcohol to illegal drugs.

You can legally refuse to take a sobriety test, but the penalties you face will often be much harsher than they would be if you complied. A refusal does make proving intoxication more difficult, but your refusal can also be used against you in your prosecution.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="IS REPRESENTING YOURSELF AN OPTION?" font_container="tag:h4|text_align:left|color:%23000000" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]Anyone can represent themselves in our legal system, but this is never recommended. Even the most skilled criminal defense attorney will hire another lawyer if they face criminal charges. It’s difficult for someone representing himself or herself to remain objective and maintain credibility in front of a judge and jury.

More importantly, the average citizen has a limited understanding of our laws and court system. It’s vital to seek legal representation as soon as you suspect that you will be facing criminal charges. An attorney can keep you informed about laws related to your situation and be proactive in handling the specific legal requirements of your case. Regardless of how intelligent or competent you are, don’t fall prey to the idea that you should be your own advocate in court.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="WHY YOU NEED A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY" font_container="tag:h4|text_align:left|color:%23000000" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text]A DUI defense lawyer in Columbia, SC plays one of the most important roles in our criminal justice system. They are advocates for people who have been accused of a crime. They possess a deep knowledge of their state’s laws.

The legal system can be complicated and fraught with potential for self-incrimination. In other words, the actions you take and the words you say can do your case great harm.

A good criminal defense attorney is knowledgeable, assertive and experienced. It often takes years to build a successful legal practice, so it’s typically in a person’s best interest to seek an attorney who has a track record of success. Look for an attorney who has the skill and resources to give your case the best possible chance of success. They will have a history of getting results for clients, and they’ll have access to expert witnesses that they can use on your behalf.
