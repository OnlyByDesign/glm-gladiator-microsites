The damages aren’t always just in property damage and money; the costs often include the health of the driver and the passengers involved, both physical and psychological. The car accident lawyers of Khalidi Law Firm, PLLC are here to help those injured in motor vehicle collisions by filing personal injury claims against the negligent parties responsible for these injuries.

<h2>Causes of TBI Seen by Our Brain Injury Lawyers</h2>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Car Accidents</span></h3>
<strong><img class="wp-image-6208 size-full alignright" src="https://www.tnklaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/car-crash.jpg" alt="Arizona Car Crash Attorney" width="200" height="200" /><a href="https://www.tnklaw.com/vehicle-accidents/car-crashes/">Car accidents</a> are a frequent cause of brain injuries.</strong> The CDC reports that 14.3 percent of TBIs are caused by auto accidents, for a yearly total of roughly 286,00 per year. Part of the issue with any brain injury, but especially with those sustained in car crashes, is that symptoms may not appear until later. Because of this, it is extremely important to seek immediate medical treatment for any accident. This also provides important documentation in case of a personal injury suit. The condition of the vehicle after an accident is not always an accurate indicator of the physical sate of a vehicle’s occupants; medical records can be crucial to proving injuries caused.
<div style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Slips and Falls</span></h3>
<strong><img class="size-full wp-image-6206 alignleft" src="https://www.tnklaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/slip-fall.jpg" alt="Arizona Slip and Fall Injury Attorney" width="200" height="200" /><a href="/personal-injury/slip-fall-injuries/">Slip and fall injuries</a> are among the leading causes of TBI in the United States.</strong> According to the CDC, 40.5 percent of TBIs are the result of slip and fall injuries. No matter where the injury occurs, it is important to assess what caused the fall. This is especially true if the slip or fall occurred at the mall, a restaurant, a store, or other similar location. If it was caused by a slippery floor, inadequate lighting, or shoddy equipment, documentation is important in order to pursue a claim in court, to establish fault and to make sure similar accidents don’t reoccur.

</div>
<div>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sports-Related </span></h3>
<strong>An issue that has garnered a significant amount of publicity lately are TBIs resulting from sports.</strong> Some sports, including boxing and mixed martial arts, include direct head shots, American football, with its frequent head-to-head contact; and soccer, with its headers of balls going at excessive speeds; and even lower impact sports such as basketball or baseball may cause TBI.

</div>
<img class="alignright wp-image-6210 size-full" src="https://www.tnklaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sports-injury.jpg" alt="Arizona Sports-Related Brain Injury Lawyer" width="200" height="200" />Because of the heightened awareness, research has been conducted, especially on the brains of deceased former boxers and football players, to study the cause and effects of the injuries. The findings are chilling. A recent Washington Post report indicates that as many as 40 percent of former professional football players may suffer from TBI. The Neurological Rehabilitation Institute reports that for boxers the percentage is much higher, with potentially 90 percent of former boxers suffering brain injuries at some time in their career, due primarily to the repeated pounding; thus, these athletes suffer a higher risk contracting Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease.

The research and publicity has caused some much-needed changes in rules, especially in football, to protect players from head and neck injuries as much as possible. Still, the danger exists. The legal question has become one of fault: Was the injury the result of equipment, a team, an individual or even the league itself for not implementing more regulations?

<h2>Classification of Brain Injuries</h2>
Brain injuries can range in scope from mild to severe. A brain injury is typically classified as mild if loss of consciousness and/or confusion a lasts for less than 30 minutes. Some traumatic brain injuries (TBI) result in permanent neurobiological damage that can produce lifelong deficits to varying degrees. Moderate to severe brain injuries typically refer to injuries that have the following characteristics:
<ul>
 	<li>Moderate brain injury is defined as a brain injury resulting in a loss of consciousness for 20 minutes to 6 hours.</li>
 	<li>Severe brain injury is defined as a brain injury resulting in a loss of consciousness for longer than 6 hours.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms of Mild TBI</h2>
The symptoms of mild TBIs -- also frequently called <strong>concussions</strong> -- are not always present immediately following the accident or event producing the injury. It may take days, or even weeks, before the victim and/or his family notices the following signs:
<ul>
 	<li>Fatigue</li>
 	<li>Headaches<img class="alignright wp-image-6211 size-full" src="https://www.tnklaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/concussion-.jpg" alt="Arizona Traumatic Brain Injury Attorney" width="400" height="400" /></li>
 	<li>Visual disturbances</li>
 	<li>Memory loss</li>

 	<li>Sleep disturbances</li>
 	<li>Dizziness/loss of balance</li>
 	<li>Irritability-emotional disturbances</li>
 	<li>Feelings of depression</li>
 	<li>Seizures</li>
</ul>
In addition, some victims of mild TBI experience these less common symptoms:
<ul>
 	<li>Nausea</li>
 	<li>Loss of smell</li>
 	<li>Sensitivity to light and sounds</li>
 	<li>Mood changes</li>

<h2>How Brain Injuries Affect Children</h2>
Even comparatively mild injuries, such as hypoxic brain damage (brief oxygen starvation suffered during birth), can have lifelong consequences, such as emotional and intellectual challenges for the rest of this young person’s life. Anoxia (extended oxygen starvation during childbirth) can lead to cerebral palsy and a host of other tragic mental and physiological disorders.
Outcomes can be just as grim for children who suffer a TBI from a blow to the head or a case of shaken baby syndrome. TBI is a leading cause of death and disability in infants, toddlers, and adolescents, and it can negatively impact brain maturation and development as they get older. If a young child suffers a serious TBI, medical and rehabilitation expenses for the rest of their life can be as much as several million dollars.

<h2>Consequences of Traumatic Brain Injuries</h2>
A traumatic brain injury most often produces permanent neurobiological damage that can produce varying degrees of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), forcing the victim to temporarily lose consciousness for several hours or more. Some lie in a coma for days before regaining consciousness. Noticeable physical and cognitive impairment can be permanent for the remainder of the victim’s life.
TBI victims can experience several types of emotional problems. Mood swings can feel like riding an emotional roller coaster for the victim due to damage to the portion of the brain that controls emotions and behavior. Such sudden, unexplainable emotional responses by the injured victim can cause those around the person to believe that they caused the emotional outburst.
Often, these symptoms are associated with early TBI diagnosis. Over time, however, much of the behavior may disappear, though not completely go away.
This can have an emotionally debilitating effect on those who live with and are around the TBI victim. The need for trained psychological and psychiatric specialists is obvious, perhaps for the rest of the TBI victim’s life. This can become quite expensive.

<h2>For Severe Head Injuries, Talk to Our Tucson Brain Damage Attorney</h2>
Any injury can be terrible. Injuries can debilitate even the strongest person. In most cases, the essence of the person with a physical injury remains the same before and after it occurs, but isn’t always the case with traumatic brain injuries (TBI).
<div class="callout">With a severe brain injury, it’s possible that the person who emerges following treatment will seem to be someone different, with personality changes and emotional responses unlike those before the trauma, and will likely be disabled.</div>
The Centers for Disease Control estimate that 1.5 million people in the United States suffer from one of the two types of Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) -- mild or severe -- each year. Of those suffering a TBI, 50,000 die each year and 85,000 suffer long-term injury. Overall there are 5.3 million Americans living with a TBI.

<h2>Can You Recover from a Brain Injury?</h2>
Unlike most other parts of the body, brain cells do not regenerate once they are destroyed. Some improvement in their condition is possible, relative to the type and seriousness of the victim’s injury. Our brains can “rewire themselves” to a point where certain functions can be re-gained. Doctors call this brain “plasticity.”

Generally, if there is any improvement, it will be detected between six months and two years after the injury. Improvements slow considerably after that, but may still progress indefinitely and at a much slower pace.

Most mild TBIs do not cause permanent or long-term disability. Neurologists generally accept that permanent disability occurs in 10 percent of mild TBI, 66 percent of moderate, and 100 percent of severe TBI.

<h2>Treatment of Brain Injuries</h2>
Treatments for brain injuries are as varied as the injuries themselves. <strong>Several variables must be taken into consideration</strong>: How severe is the injury? What condition is the person in? What are the symptoms? How adversely has the injury affected the individual? How has it affected quality of life? What secondary injuries result from the brain injury? Is the person disabled, and, if so, by how much?
<div class="callout">Treatment for brain injuries must be versatile, but it all starts with an assessment. From there it depends on the injury.</div>
To learn more about potential treatment options, the Brain Injury Association of America has created a <a href="http://www.biausa.org/brain-injury-treatment.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">diagram detailing different options.</a>

<h2>Monetary Damages in Brain Injury Cases</h2>
Damages available to brain injury victims include those associated with medical treatment, lost wages (present and future), pain and suffering and other expenses incurred as a result of the harm. Our Tucson head and brain injury lawyer will fight aggressively for you to receive damages for your brain injury legal claim. Our team has skilled and seasoned litigators ready to go to court when necessary.

With adult victims, it’s usually easier to compute all lost income by using earnings history, education and how those earnings project into the future. Child brain injury victims are more difficult because of what they might do and how much they could earn during their lifetime of working is unknown.

The degree of the injury and accompanying mental/physical disability also factors into brain injury damage awards. Specialized care alone for these severely injured victims can easily cost $250,000 or more annually. And the pain and emotional suffering which a brain injury victim endures can sometimes seem incalculable. Family members are also deeply affected as seldom will their loved one completely return to their former pre-accident condition.
<h2 style="text-align: left;">How Much Money Can You Expect in Your Brain Damage Case?</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">The broad scope of potential damages is why these awards can range from the $14.25 million won at trial by a Pennsylvania woman whose car was struck by a commercial truck in 2008, to the $600,000 settlement awarded to an Illinois passenger in 2013 after suffering a moderate TBI when the driver of the car he was in fell asleep and crashed his vehicle.</p>

<h2>Our Tucson Brain Injury Lawyer Helps Head Injury Victims</h2>
Brain injuries can arise from many different accidental events. They could occur due to a concussion while playing sports, or from a car wreck, a tumble from a bicycle or motorcycle wreck, or appear in an infant after shaken baby syndrome or from medical malpractice during delivery. Many brain injuries also happen on construction sites or after a slip-and-fall.

Cognitive problems, loss of motor function, memory loss, speech impairments, permanent disability, and even wrongful death can all be tied to a brain injury, even if it began with just a bump on the head.
