Many brain injuries also happen on construction sites or after a slip-and-fall.</p>

        <div class="spacer-bar"></div>
        <p class="content-left">Personal injuries occur when someone is injured or killed because of an accident, negligence or the misconduct of another, and they can happen to anyone. If you or someone you love has been the victim of an accident, misconduct or negligence — in an <a href="https://www.tnklaw.com/practice/auto-accidents/">auto collision</a>, while on the job, crossing the street, in a <a href="https://www.tnklaw.com/medical-malpractice/" rel="nofollow">hospital</a> or <a href="https://www.tnklaw.com/nursing-home-abuse/" rel="nofollow">nursing home</a>, or in any number of situations — a personal injury attorney at the Khalidi Law Firm, PLLC has the experience and the resources to help you gain full and fair compensation for your losses.</p>

                <h3>Why You Need a Tucson Personal Injury Attorney</h3>
                <p>Anyone can file a personal injury claim, with or without an attorney. While you could technically handle your claim on your own, let us tell you why you shouldn’t. When the stakes are as high as they usually are in a personal injury claim, you should leave as little to chance as possible.</p>
                <p>The learning curve in a contentious legal matter is incredibly steep. Without an attorney, you’d first need the world’s fastest crash course in civil litigation. You’d also be much more likely to settle for far less than you deserve because you would have no frame of reference for how much your claim is worth.</p>
                <p>When you seek compensation in a personal injury claim, there will be many forces working against you, including highly skilled and experienced attorneys and insurance company representatives. When you have your own skilled, experienced personal injury attorney, you level the playing field and ensure that you won’t be taken advantage of.</p>

        <ul class="checkmarks" style="list-style: none;">

        <h2 class="glm center-content"><strong>What You Should Do After Being Injured</strong></h2>
        <div class="spacer-bar"></div>
        <p>If you’ve been injured, your priority should be your own health. Seek immediate medical care. You should also notify someone as soon as possible. If you’re injured in a car accident, you’ll call the police to respond to the scene to file a report. If you’re injured in a medical facility, you’ll notify the staff as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>After seeking medical care, you should keep copies of bills you receive or receipts for any other expenses you incur stemming from your injury. You might be contacted by insurance companies in the days, weeks or months that follow. If it’s your own insurance company, then cooperate with them to the best of your ability. <strong>If it is an insurance company of another party, do not speak to them</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you’ve suffered serious injuries because of someone else’s carelessness, you should contact a personal injury attorney. The statute of limitations on personal injury claims in Arizona is two years from the time of the injury. However, it is best to contact your attorney as soon as possible. An attorney can help you avoid mistakes and begin the process of filing a claim immediately.</p>

Our Tucson personal injury lawyers offer free consultations, so we can learn more about your situation and give you an honest case evaluation.</p>
        
        <h2 style="margin-top:35px;">Contact a Personal Injury Firm That Understands the True Impact of Your Pain</h2>
        <p>The term “pain and suffering” gets tossed around a lot in the legal community. It’s used so often that people may seem jaded about these “non-economic” consequences of an injury.
        At the Khalidi Law Firm, we know that your pain is more than just one item on a list of other types of damages you’ve suffered after an accident.</p>
        <p>Our biggest priority is to understand our client’s pain and do whatever necessary to help them alleviate it.

                <h3>How Much Does it Cost to Hire a Personal Injury Lawyer?</h3>
                <p>Every prospective personal injury client is entitled to a free initial consultation with one of our Tucson personal injury lawyers. During this meeting, the attorney will gather facts which allow us to make an initial assessment of the case. Based on this evaluation, it’s possible we may find your harm is not compensable or that the chances of recovery are not likely, or we may find that we should proceed with a lawsuit to recover damages for your losses.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal injury cases are typically handled on a contingency basis.</strong></p>
                <p>Under this arrangement, you will not pay any attorneys’ fees unless there is a recovery by settlement or verdict. Under this kind of agreement, we receive compensation for our work after we recover money for you based on a set percentage of the total recovery, consistent with applicable law and regulations.</p>
                <p>Costs related to your case are paid at the conclusion and are separate and distinct from our attorneys’ fees. Some common examples of these costs are filing documents with the court, serving defendants with notice, obtaining records and hiring experts.</p>
                <h3>How Will the Value of my Personal Injury Case be Determined?</h3>
                <p>There is no set or predetermined formula for determining the value of a personal injury case. Depending on the type and severity of your injury, you may be entitled to reimbursement for medical bills, time lost from work, medical costs for resulting injuries, pain and suffering, and more. A Tucson personal injury attorney will estimate the value of your lawsuit based on expert assessments and evidence, such as whether there are discrepancies in the testimony, medical records, or other issues that may detract from the integrity of the injured party’s case.</p>
                <p>The following factors will be considered when determining the amount of compensation owed for your injuries: the severity of your injuries; the details of your accident; your degree of fault; your employment history; your ability to work; and your life expectancy. The manner in which you obtain medical treatment, your lifestyle, and your litigation history will also be considered.</p>
                <p><strong>The law allows recovery for a wide range of situations, including hospital bills; medical costs; rehabilitation and therapy services; lost wages since the injury occurred; lost future income; pain and suffering and decreased or loss of ability to engage in regular life activities.</strong></p>
                <p>When someone is injured, other members of the family may be affected as well. Those harms may be recovered separately from the damages awarded to the individual who was hurt. We will explain whether that situation applies in your case.</p>
                <p>It is wise to be skeptical of the value an insurance company places on your injury. The company does not have your best interests in mind. In fact, they have incentives to drastically underestimate the value of your losses. Only a legal professional with a duty to fight for your interests can provide a fair assessment of the value of your injury.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-left column-padding four" style="display: inline-block; vertical-align: top;">
                <h3>Should I Accept a Settlement from the Insurance Company?</h3>
                <p>An insurance company’s interest is to ensure that you receive as little compensation as possible for your injury. The insurance adjuster is likely rewarded for resolving claims quickly and for as little compensation as possible. It is not uncommon for an insurance adjuster to visit an injured party soon after an accident occurs, when the victim is physically and emotionally vulnerable. The adjuster may come with an offer to entice you to accept a settlement for far less than you could recover if you had legal representation. It is prudent to not to sign away your rights without being fully apprised of the consequences. A personal injury lawyer in Tucson will ensure that the company actually pays the full value of the claim, taking into account all of your past and future losses.</p>
                <h3>Should I Provide the Insurance Company with a Recorded Statement?</h3>
                <p>The simple answer is no, or at least not until you have been advised by a personal injury attorney. When an accident occurs, it is common for an insurance company to ask the injured party to make a recorded statement. These statements are usually requested immediately after the accident, when you may not fully know or understand the full extent of your injuries. Insurance adjusters are trained to discreetly influence you into saying something that will protect their company from liability or limit your claim against it. It is very easy for comments in recorded statements to be taken out of context and used against you in litigation. The ultimate cost of this to you could be hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars.</p>
