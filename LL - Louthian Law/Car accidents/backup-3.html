        <h2>Common Causes of South Carolina Car Accident</h2>
        
        <div class="col-xs-8 clearfloat">
            <p class="inline col content-left clearfloat">South Carolina automobile accidents are often devastating, but never more so than when they are caused by the carelessness of another party. Drivers engage in many dangerous and negligent behaviors on the roads. <strong>Some of the factors most likely to cause preventable accidents include:</strong></p>
            <ul class="full-width clearfix inline push-t">
                <li><img src="#" /><p><strong><a href="/vehicle-accidents/car-accident-lawyer/speeding-accidents/">Speeding</a></strong> -- The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration reports that speed is one of the most common factors in traffic accidents in Columbia and throughout South Carolina. In the majority of speeding-related crashes (55 percent), drivers were going over the speed limit. In the remainder of crashes, drivers are operating their vehicles too fast for road conditions.</p></li>
                <li><img src="#" /><p><strong><a href="/vehicle-accidents/distracted-driving/">Distracted Driving</a></strong> -- 3,092 people died and another 416,000 were injured in 2010 as a result of distracted drivers, according to Distraction.gov.</p></li>
                <li><img src="#" /><p><strong><a href="/vehicle-accidents/car-accident-lawyer/drunk-driving/">Drunk Driving</a></strong> -- The Centers for Disease Control report that 30 people each day die throughout the United States in drunk driving crashes.</p></li>
                <li><img src="#" /><p><strong><a href="/vehicle-accidents/car-accident-lawyer/automobile-defects/">Automotive Defects</a></strong> -- Some car accidents result from problems with the vehicle itself. In those situations, it could be possible to recover damages from the companies responsible for the car’s defective design or construction.</p></li>
                <li><img src="#" /><p><strong><a href="/vehicle-accidents/car-accident-lawyer/reckless-driving/">Reckless Driving</a></strong> -- Also called “aggressive driving,” this includes many dangerous behaviors behind the wheel, such as tailgating, unsafe lane changes and weaving in traffic.</p></li>
                <li><img src="#" /><p><strong><a href="/vehicle-accidents/car-accident-lawyer/drowsy-driving/">Drowsy Driving</a></strong> -- Studies show that driver fatigue is a major threat to highway safety in Columbia, South Carolina and across the country. Even if a drowsy driver manages to stay awake, reaction times and decision-making abilities are often impaired, which could cause a crash.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="push-t inline col content-left clearfloat"><strong>Other causes of car accidents include...</strong> drivers who disobey the rules of the road, such as failing to yield or failing to obey traffic signals, as well as drivers who simply behave in a careless way while driving. Following too closely and aggressive driving are also major contributors to car accidents. In any situation where a driver breaks the law or engages in behavior that is unreasonably careless, that driver can be held legally responsible for the damage that he or she caused. In legal terms, the driver is classified as negligent and can be sued for this negligence.</p>

            <h2>How Bad are Auto Accidents in Columbia South Carolina?</h2>
            <div class="spacer-bar"></div>
            <p>According to the Department of Public Safety, there were 589 fatal South Carolina car accidents between January 1, 2012, and October 18, 2012. These fatal crashes resulted in 632 deaths of passengers, drivers, pedestrians, bicycle riders and others sharing the road. The Department of Public Safety also reported on the total number of fatal South Carolina vehicle crashes and fatalities in 2011. Their statistics indicate that 625 fatal crashes in 2011 resulted in 677 deaths in Columbia and across South Carolina.</p>
            <p>As the figures demonstrate, car accidents cause far too many people to lose their lives. In fact, the CDC indicates that car crashes are the leading killer of both kids and young adults throughout the U.S. and are among the top cause of death in all age groups.</p>
            <p class="push-b">These devastating losses due to car accident deaths in Columbia and throughout South Carolina are, unfortunately, only the tip of the iceberg. South Carolina car crashes also cause thousands of injuries, both serious and minor, as well as significant property damage. Extensive financial and emotional costs are also associated with car crashes.</p>

            <p>In some Columbia, South Carolina car accidents, the victims’ recovery is complicated by dealing with a bureaucratic or hostile insurance company. Even loyal customers who have paid their premiums on time for years may find themselves arguing with insurance adjusters about whose fault an accident was, the value of damages, what kind of coverage they have and other issues that can significantly change how much compensation they are entitled to.</p>
            <p>If an insurance company refuses to pay a valid car accident claim, it’s called <a href="/vehicle-accidents/insurance-bad-faith/">insurance bad faith</a> and it is illegal. An experienced Columbia car accident attorney can help you hold the insurance company to its end of the bargain and collect the compensation you are entitled to.</p>

A driver who was sending a text and hit a pedestrian, for example, was negligent. They didn’t mean to hurt the other driver, but it was their careless behavior that led to the pedestrian’s injury.</p>

            <h2>Tips for dealing with the insurance agency</h2>
            <div class="spacer-bar"></div>
            <p>When dealing with another person’s insurance company, you do not have to speak with or issue a statement to their representative. If you have a car accident attorney handling your case, you should tell the insurance company to speak to an experienced Columbia car accident lawyer.</p>
            <p class="push-b">After an automobile accident, you will contact your insurance company. You should cooperate with them and answer their questions about the situation. Once they offer you a settlement, it is up to you to determine whether the offer is adequate. You do not have to accept the first offer they make.</p>
            <h3 class="content-left no-push">Statute of limitations</h3>
            <p class="push-b">The statute of limitations – the window of time in which you have to file a claim – for a personal injury claim is two years in Columbia and throughout South Carolina. It’s always best to act quickly if you are considering filing a claim.</p>
            <h3 class="content-left no-push">Settlement vs. Trial</h3>
            <p>After an injury claim is filed, the two sides will negotiate potential payment to the injured party. If the two sides come to an agreement, there will be a settlement. If not, the matter will go to trial. This process can take several weeks to several months, or longer, depending on the circumstances of the case.</p>
            <p><strong>HOW DOES A SETTLEMENT WORK?</strong> A settlement is the resolution of a case through an agreement between both sides in a lawsuit. Typically, a settlement is preceded by a dialogue and negotiation between the legal representatives of the plaintiffs and defendants listed in the case.</p>
            <p><strong>HOW DOES A TRIAL WORK?</strong>A trial occurs when a settlement is not reached. In a trial, the matter is taken to court, where each side’s attorney makes the case for their client in front of a judge and jury. The jury will decide if the defendant was at fault and how much the plaintiff is owed.</p>

            <h2 class="content-left no-push">How fault is determined</h2>
            <p>Fault is a key component of an injury claim. Car accident attorneys conduct investigations to determine whose actions contributed to your injuries. If those actions were considered negligent, then the negligent party should be held accountable for the costs stemming from your injury.</p>
            <p>It can require a great deal of research to find out who was at fault for an accident. An experienced attorney has been through this process several times and will know what to look for.</p>

            <p>Traffic crash fatalities were expected to exceed 40,000 in the United States in 2015, for the first time since 2007. A number of factors may explain the increase, one of which is the economy.</p>
            <p>Spending was down nationwide, during a recession that began in December 2007. Although it officially ended in June 2009, many people continued to suffer the effects of a sluggish economy for years, after being unemployed, losing equity in their homes, and losing investment funds. But in 2015, the economy began to rebound, and people began buying new cars and taking road trips.
