<h2 class="center-content">What to Expect After an Auto Accident in New York</h2>
<div class="spacer-bar"></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. </strong>After a vehicle crash, police officers and possibly emergency medical responders will come to the scene of the crash.</li>
<li><strong>2. </strong>The police officer will ask you some basic questions about the incident.</li>
<li><strong>3. </strong>If you have suffered injuries, you will be treated and may be taken to the hospital for further examinations. It is always best to seek medical treatment, even if you suspect your injuries are minor.</li>
<li><strong>4. </strong>Keep copies of police reports and medical bills. In the days or weeks that follow, you will be contacted by insurers (both your own and that of the other driver).</li>
<li><strong>5. </strong>You DO NOT have to speak to another driver’s insurance company. Instead, tell them to speak to your attorney. After a vehicle crash, you might be able to receive compensation for the damages suffered, even if you share some fault for the incident.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Most Common Causes of Auto Accidents in New York</h2>
There are many causes behind the staggering number of accidents. They include <a href="/vehicle-accident-attorneys/drunk-driving-accidents/">drinking and driving</a>, failure to obey traffic controls and aggressive driving. But <a href="/vehicle-accident-attorneys/distracted-driving/">distracted driving</a> continues to be the leading cause of car accidents. The most significant distraction to drivers today is the use of cellular phones and other mobile devices. Studies show that texting takes a driver’s eyes off the road for approximately five seconds. If a driver is traveling at 55 miles per hour, he will travel the length of a football field without looking at the road while sending a text. 
<h2 style="padding-top: 20px;">Types of injuries</h2>
A vehicle accident can lead to very serious injuries, including…
<ul class="showbullets">
 	<li>Traumatic brain injuries</li>
 	<li>Spinal cord injuries or paralysis</li>
 	<li>Internal injuries</li>
 	<li>Broken bones</li>
 	<li>Whiplash</li>
 	<li>Soft-tissue damage</li>
 	<li>PTSD</li>
 	<li>Wrongful death.</li>
</ul>
In many cases, a car accident causes more than just one injury. You might be suffering from extensive trauma that is expensive to treat and limits your ability to work. If this is the case, you have experienced significant damages from your accident, and you should contact Kaplan Lawyers PC to explore your legal path toward compensation.<a name="two"></a>

<h2>No-Fault Laws in New York</h2>
<div class="spacer-bar"></div>
<p class="content-left">In 1973 the New York State Legislature passed what is commonly referred to as the “No-Fault Law” to provide for the economic needs of people injured in automobile accidents. No-fault coverage will pay for medical bills, prescription costs, household services, transportation to medical providers, and lost wages up to the amount of coverage selected by the policyholder. However, there are many restrictions and filing requirements relating to no-fault laws, so it is essential that you consult with our car accident lawyers to ensure that you receive all the benefits you are legally entitled to. Additionally, the true intent of the no-fault law was to limit an injured person’s ability to collect money for their pain and suffering. The statute is very restrictive, and many people who suffer significant injuries do not receive compensation for the impact that an accident has had on their lives. <a name="seven"></a></p>
<div class="column-wrapper">
<div class="column-left content-left column-padding">
<h3>How is fault determined?</h3>
Each state has its own set of laws regarding fault. New York is a comparative fault state, which means that even if someone was partially responsible for an incident that caused their injury, they still have the legal right to pursue compensation for the damages they have suffered.
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Tips for Dealing with the Insurance Agency</h3>
<ul class="showbullets">
<li>You are under no obligation to speak to another driver’s insurance representative. It’s likely that they will do whatever they can to lessen the amount of money they pay you.</li>
<li>If possible, they will find a way to deny your claim completely. One of the ways they do this is by using your own words against you. If you are contacted by another driver’s insurance company, tell them to talk to your attorney.</li>
<li>When it comes to your own insurance company, you should be cooperative and report your accident and injuries after they happen.</li>
<li>It’s also important to know that you don’t have to settle for an offer that doesn’t meet your needs. If you are offered less than you deserve, consider having an attorney argue your case for you.
</ul>
</div>
<div class="column-right content-left column-padding">
<h3>What is Negligence?</h3>
Negligence is one of the most important concepts in personal injury law. Negligence is carelessness or recklessness. If someone acts in a manner that disregards the safety of others, whether or not they intend to cause harm, they are considered negligent.
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Why You Need an Attorney</h3>
To handle a personal injury claim properly, you need…
<ul class="showbullets">
 	<li>A deep understanding of the law.</li>
 	<li>The time and resources to handle the day-to-day processes of filing a claim, such as preparing and filing paperwork, corresponding with attorneys and insurance companies, and gathering evidence to build your case.</li>
 	<li>Access to expert witnesses that can back up your claims with credible science and experience.</li>
 	<li>The experience to avoid common mistakes people make when filing a claim on their own.</li>
 	<li>The knowledge and resources to research laws and relevant cases to build a successful case.</li>
</ul>
Few non-attorneys possess the skill, knowledge and experience required to meet the challenge. By having an attorney represent you in a personal injury case, you’ll be maximizing your case’s chances for success and making sure you aren’t settling for less compensation than you deserve.

<h2>Getting Medical Treatment</h2>
<div class="spacer-bar" style="margin-left:0;"></div>
If you suspect you have suffered an injury, the most important step you can take is to seek medical attention. Even if you aren’t sure how seriously you are injured, your health is never something you want to risk. There are also legal ramifications if you forgo needed medical treatment. An opposing attorney or an insurance company will allege that you were never seriously injured if you didn’t bother to see a doctor. Don’t risk your health or give the other side the opportunity to make this argument. Get medical treatment.

<h4>Featured Article: Is Society Evolving Into a More Dangerous World for Drivers?</h4>
There is a narrative we hold near and dear in America: Progress makes life better. In a blink of the proverbial eye, technology has created a world that is more connected and convenient than ever before. For the most part, we’re healthier, safer, and smarter. For all their virtues, emerging technologies bring with them their own challenges. Innovation opens the door to both improvement and peril. I submit that we’re seeing a bit of both on the highway horizon. <a href="https://www.kaplanlawyers.com/vehicle-accident-attorneys/dangerous-driving-accidents/">Read Full Article</a>

<h2>Things to Always Keep in Mind</h2>
<div class="spacer-bar"></div>
<div class="column-wrapper">
<div class="column-left content-left column-padding">
<h3>Do I still have a lawsuit if I was in a single-car crash?</h3>
<p>There are many situations in which a single-car crash can result in a successful injury claim. For example, a product liability claim can be filed if a defective vehicle caused your crash. If another driver causes your crash because they were reckless, they can still be held accountable for costs associated with your injuries. In other words, if your accident was caused by someone else’s negligence, you should still consider your legal options.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">How do I know if I have a claim?</h3>
If you…
<ul class="showbullets">
<li>a) Have been injured,</li>
<li>b) Have incurred major expenses and damages from the injury, and</li>
<li>c) Believe that your injuries are someone else’s fault…</li>
</ul>
You likely have an injury claim. Contact a personal injury attorney to find out more about your legal options.
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">What is a contingency fee?</h3>
<p>A contingency fee means that the client pays the attorney’s fee only if the case is successful and owes nothing if it is not. At Kaplan Lawyers PC, we operate on a contingency fee.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Settlement vs. Trial</h3>
<p>A settlement is the resolution of a lawsuit through an agreement for a specified amount of money. When such an agreement can’t be reached, the matter goes to trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="column-right content-left column-padding">
<h3>How much is my case worth?</h3>
<p>An injury claim can range from thousands to millions of dollars. It all depends on the extent of the damages you have experienced. The more serious and costly the injuries you’ve suffered, the more you should be given in compensation for those injuries. To get an estimate of your case’s value, contact an experienced personal injury attorney for a free consultation.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Statute of limitations</h3>
<p>In New York, the window of time you have in which to file a claim is three years from the date of your injury. However, it’s always best to start your claim as soon as possible to maximize the chances of a successful case.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Costs of an attorney</h3>
<p>Launching a personal injury claim can be an intensive process for a law firm. The time, effort and resources required to build a successful case can be substantial. Attorneys can choose how they want to be paid. Some may work on an hourly rate, while others might want some payment upfront. However, many personal injury lawyers work on a contingency fee. This type of payment is good for clients because it means that they don’t have to carry the costs of a claim if it is ultimately unsuccessful.</p>

<h3>How does a settlement work?</h3>
<p>A settlement usually requires a significant amount of negotiations between the legal representatives of the parties involved in the lawsuit. The process can be quick (resolved in a matter of several days or weeks) or take more time (several months or longer), depending on the complexities of the case.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">What leads to a successful lawsuit?</h3>
<p>A successful lawsuit is the result of a sustained, strategic effort of an attorney and his or her team. An attorney must gather evidence, conduct investigations, consult experts, research laws and build a case that can be presented before a jury.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Should I feel bad about suing someone?</h3>
<p>There’s no reason to feel bad about filing a lawsuit against someone who truly carries responsibility for the injuries you’ve suffered. It is only fair that they pay for their role in the incident. In many cases, the compensation you’re seeking will be paid by an insurance company. It’s also helpful to consider the larger context of your claim. Because lawsuits hold negligent people and organizations accountable for wrongdoing, they can prevent others from suffering similar injuries by discouraging further negligent behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="column-right content-left column-padding">
<h3>How does a trial work?</h3>
<p>In a trial, both sides’ legal representatives argue their client’s cases before a judge and a jury. The jury will decide if the person accused of causing injuries should be held responsible and how much they owe the injured party.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Who can be sued?</h3>
<p>Anyone who bears fault for the injuries you’ve suffered should be held accountable in a lawsuit. It can be one person or several people. It can be a business or organization. When you hire an attorney, they will investigate the circumstances surrounding your case to help you determine who was at fault and who will be named in your lawsuit.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top:25px;"></h3>
