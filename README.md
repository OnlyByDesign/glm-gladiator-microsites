Gladiator Law Marketing | Directory for all microsites and pages built for them

Working with GLM was a hoot and a half!

I was responsibile for layout large pages of content in a more digestible and concise way

I was also responsible for:
1. Overhauling website content and settings up styling for future use
2. Translating client needs into tangible application (working with clients to get them what they wanted)
3. Maintaininig company policy and security procedures when it came to inline HTML and CSS structure, as well as SEO
