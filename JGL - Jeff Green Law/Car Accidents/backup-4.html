Our experienced team of legal and technical specialists work together to examine the causes and factors involved in car accidents, determine accountability and liability, and take into consideration all extenuating and environmental circumstances.

If alcohol or drugs are involved or suspected to be a cause contributing to the accident, we will gather breathalyzer and blood sample results to determine the degree of the driver’s intoxication at the time of the crash. If video is available of the incident, we’ll obtain it. If the driver has a history of being involved in crashes, we will use that information when building our case. We travel to the scene of the crash, take photos, measure skid marks, and research and document weather patterns for the day of the incident. We research the history of problematic locations where there may have been repeated incidents, collect police reports, and interview witnesses.

<strong>Put simply</strong>, we leave no stone unturned when it comes to determining negligence and fighting for your rights to just compensation.[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="Our past results are proof of our success in fighting for our clients' rights.

Included in what you might collect are costs such as medical bills, lost time/wages from work, worker’s compensation claims, vehicle repairs, property loss (items in the car that were damaged), and pain and suffering/emotional distress damages. While some costs are clear cut, like the cost of a car repair, others depend on your earnings, how heavily you were impacted by the crash mentally and physically, and what long-term consequences you may suffer, if any. While the case is in process, you may be required to pay for some expenses up front, and then, in the lawsuit, we’ll ask for reimbursement of those expenses to be added to the total dollar amount we seek to obtain on your behalf.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

Our offices are experienced in handling all the facets of compensation in a car accident case, and we work to ensure that your costs are covered and that you are justly compensated for the wrong that has been done to you. When you meet with our car accident lawyer in Peoria and our team, we’ll go over the facts and figures in your case in our free consultation appointment, and we'll calculate the amount that would cover all expenses, costs, and damages.

The circumstances of each auto accident are different, as are the histories of the parties involved. It’s important to keep in mind that insurance companies are looking out for their own company’s best interest. To avoid paying your claim, they may try to say you were at fault when you were not. They might agree to reimburse the bare bones of your costs; but if you want to seek compensation for the totality of the hurt you have experienced as the result of a car accident, encompassing all of your expenses, including pain and suffering and emotional distress, you will need to hire an experienced Peoria car accident attorney so that you can file a lawsuit.

[/vc_column_text][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/2"][vc_column_text]

An experienced attorney acts as your trusted advisor, evaluating your case and representing your interests. They assist you with recouping all of the expenses and damages incurred as a result of the crash. If you are made to feel unsure who was at fault, or there are extenuating circumstances that complicate the car accident, our experienced team can evaluate the case during our free initial consultation and give you a better understanding of your chances with a lawsuit. At Jeff Green Law, we put our resources to work for you in arriving at a full and fair settlement; and if the insurance company does not settle, our car accident attorney is ready to go to trial and represent you in your litigation efforts.

Here are some of <strong>the most common reasons</strong> for car crashes today, along with tips for things you can do to reduce your risk of causing an accident:
<ul class="nolist content-left">
 	<li>
<h3>Distracted Driving</h3>
This includes use of a phone (texting, calling, social media, etc.), a GPS unit, or the car radio, but distraction isn’t caused only by devices. Eating and drinking while driving can be extremely dangerous; and conversations and engaging with children in the back seat can distract a driver.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Fatigue</h3>
Drowsy driving is a huge contributor to accidents. If you are very tired, you should not operate a piece of machinery that weighs thousands of pounds, cruising down the road at highway speeds. Even pulling over for a short nap break during long drives can help refresh you enough to drive more safely.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Drugs/Alcohol</h3>
Driving after using drugs and/or alcohol is 100% unsafe and should be avoided every single time.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Weather</h3>
While we cannot control the weather, your driving habits should adjust accordingly when you are in bad weather. Whether you are driving in rain, snow, sleet, hail, or some combination of those conditions, SLOW DOWN and proceed with increased caution when driving in challenging weather conditions.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Speeding</h3>
Posted speed limits reflect the maximum safe speed of travel on that road, taking into consideration the road's design and other factors. Drivers who exceed the posted limit put themselves and others at risk.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Reckless Driving</h3>
When a driver disregards the safety of other people or property, their recklessness may result in a crash. Such behavior includes making quick lane changes, tailgating/following too closely, illegal passing, and drag racing. Younger drivers are particularly prone to reckless driving.</li>
 	<li>
<h3>Red Light Accidents</h3>
Many accidents are caused by a distracted or reckless driver who runs through a red light. When you're approaching an intersection, do not quickly accelerate to try to get through a yellow light before it turns red; and if your light has gone from red to green, realize that other vehicles may still be in the intersection after attempting to beat their light.</li>
</ul>

If you delay seeking treatment, it may later prove difficult to tie your injuries and illnesses to the car crash.

For obvious, simple, and minor injuries, like a broken arm, the treatment is fairly straightforward. But problems like concussions, whiplash, disc problems in the back, and mental and emotional trauma resulting from the accident can be difficult to detect immediately after an accident. These disorders and challenges can have major, lingering, negative effects on your health that might not appear until later on. If you are involved in an accident, seek medical attention immediately, and monitor your health and state of mind carefully in the days and weeks after an accident for any additional negative effects from the crash. Pay attention to signs of trauma such as pain, dizziness, nausea, and other bodily discomfort that can appear in a delayed fashion.

Always follow the directions of a physician until the treatment reaches its conclusion. Keep all of your discharge papers from any and all physicians and specialists you see while seeking treatment after an accident. Keep receipts for medications and co-pays, and keep copies of any correspondence between you and your medical professionals.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row row_mask_bg="" row_arrow="" css=".vc_custom_1545228436445{padding-top: 20px !important;}"][vc_column][vc_custom_heading text="SINGLE-CAR CRASH" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text el_class="medium-text"]Crashes which involve only one vehicle account for a <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/1118322" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">large portion</a> of accidents, and cause <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2010/09/22/avoid-single-car-crashes-lifestyle-vehicles-driving-safety.html#2b61769e1043" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">8,000</a> deaths annually. The highest percentage of these, 70%, are ROR (“run-off-road”) crashes, when the vehicle leaves the roadway and overturns or collides with something like a tree, building, pole, or other artificial or natural object. Why are ROR crashes so prevalent, and so dangerous?
<h3>Factors, as identified by the <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811232" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>:</h3>
[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text el_class="medium-text"]
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Driver Behavior:</strong> Speed, alcohol and drug use, drowsiness and distracted driving are all a factor in these types of crashes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Curvy Roadways:</strong> Curvy and winding roads are inherently dangerous, made more so when drivers exceed the posted speed limit.</li>
 	<li><strong>Rural Roads:</strong> In crashes on rural roadways, 80% are ROR as compared to 56% in urban areas, because of speeding, animals in the road, and poor lighting.</li>
 	<li><strong>Age:</strong> Younger, less experienced drivers are more likely to be involved in these crashes, due to poor judgment and distracted or drunk driving. Elderly drivers may run off the road because they overcorrect or cannotstop safely, or because of vision impairment or sudden health crises.</li>
 	<li><strong>Weather:</strong> It’s no surprise that bad weather is a contributing factor to ROR accidents. But it isn’t just rain, wind or snow at play. Dirt or dust blowing up, smoke, fog, and sand are all contributors to ROR accidents. In adverse weather conditions, 75% of crashes are ROR crashes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Time of Day:</strong> ROR accidents occur more often at night, due to lack of lighting or vision impairment.</li>
 	<li><strong>Combination of factors:</strong> Combining any of these factors multiplies the risk for a single-car accident.</li>
 	<li><strong>Type of vehicle: </strong>Passenger cars are the most likely to be involved in ROR crashes, over all other types of passenger vehicles (pickup trucks, vans, sport utility vehicles).</li>

[/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]If you are involved in any type of a single-car accident, the law firm of Jeff Green will represent your best interests by determining causes of the crash that may not have been your fault, such as objects in the road and other unavoidable factors. Consulting with our car accident attorney as soon as possible after a crash is important, so that important evidence does not disappear.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row row_mask_bg="" row_arrow="" css=".vc_custom_1545231504597{padding-top: 40px !important;}"][vc_column][vc_single_image image="4018" img_size="full" alignment="center" vc_none_hover_effect=""][vc_custom_heading text="TYPES OF INJURIES IN CAR ACCIDENTS" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text el_class="medium-text"]When you are injured in a car accident, injuries can run the gamut from minor to serious—even life-threatening or fatal. Of course, the degree and type depend on the circumstances of each particular accident, but some are more common than others.

Seeking prompt medical attention after a collision is extremely important. The adrenaline released as a result of the crash can mask injuries, and though you “feel fine,” you could have a serious underlying problem. Injuries can manifest in the days, weeks, and even months after the accident, but it is important that you seek prompt medical attention immediately after the accident so that you can prove your injuries are a result of the accident.

Listed below are some of the most common types of injuries in car crashes:
<h3>Scrapes, Cuts, and Bruises</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Scrapes, bruising, and minor abrasions are common in car accidents. Some of these can be minor, but deep bruising can be very painful and take a long time to go away. You can be injured by the seat belt restraining you during collision, by items that moved about within the car during the accident, or even by things like broken windshield glass or the car’s airbag, if it deployed during impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Injuries to the Limbs</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Your hands, arms, legs and knees can all be injured in a car accident. Everything from minor bruises to broken kneecaps and fractured arms can occur, depending on the force of the impact.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Injuries to the Chest and Torso</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The impact of an accident can be incredibly strong, causing blunt force trauma injuries to the chest and torso. Even a bruise from the seat belt can be extremely painful and last for weeks. If you are not wearing a seat belt, the damage can be even greater when your body impacts the dashboard or door. Car accidents can bruise or break your ribs, bruise or break your pelvis, and result in severe damage to your internal organs. Accidents can even trigger heart attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Back Injuries</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Back injuries as a result of a car accident can be very, very serious, and are extremely common as the body is flung around or against the seat during impact. Middle back and lower back sprains and strains are common. You can also break vertebral bones in the back of your neck and along the back, causing months if not years of pain and rehabilitation. Herniated discs can occur in the vertebral column, which can create years of back and leg pain. Damage to the spinal cord can also occur, resulting in temporary or long-term nerve damage, or temporary or permanent paralysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Head and Neck Injuries</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The force and sudden stoppage during an accident can cause the head to snap back and forth, often in an unnatural manner, causing ligament damage (“whiplash”). You can also hit your head on the steering wheel, windshield, or other windows. In some cases, the damage is not visible but there is bleeding or swelling inside the brain. Even minor concussions can have serious side effects.</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][vc_custom_heading text="LAWS RELATED TO CAR ACCIDENTS" use_theme_fonts="yes"][vc_column_text el_class="medium-text"]Understanding your rights and the law when you have been involved in a car accident in Illinois can sometimes be the last thing on your mind at the scene of the accident. You may be concerned about your injuries, or injuries to another party, damage to your car, locating and documenting insurance information for everyone involved, and so forth. Filing a lawsuit may be the last thing on your mind. But Illinois law allows for anyone to sue who believes another party was negligent and caused the accident. You must prove negligence by the other party, as well as document any damages or loss that occurs as the result of an accident.

When the police are called to the scene of an accident, they document what happened for their police report and often determine fault or negligence based on the circumstances at hand. Obtaining trusted legal counsel promptly is very important, so that your interests are represented and your rights are protected. The law office of Jeff Green has a deep bench of experience representing people involved in Illinois car accidents, including single-car crashes, and is well-versed in the laws of the state of Illinois that apply to car accidents. We have experience going after those who are negligent, as well as representing the interests of those who appear to be at fault, protecting their rights and interests.
<h3>There are laws that apply to anyone involved in a car accident in Illinois. Understanding these laws is an important first step:</h3>

<ul>
 	<li>If someone is injured, you are required to try to help them by administering some kind of aid. No one expects you to respond like a trained EMT, but ignoring someone who is injured or in danger goes against the requirement to provide basic necessary services to another human being as required by law.</li>
 	<li>You must provide information to the other driver and/or the police, such as your name, insurance information, and the name of the owner of the vehicle, if it is not you.</li>
 	<li>You are not allowed to leave the scene unless you are dismissed by the police. Even if no other car is involved, if there is property damage as the result of a car accident, leaving the scene is a <a href="https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/what-are-my-rights-when-car-accident-happens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Class A</a> misdemeanor in Illinois. Leaving the scene of a more serious accident can be a felony.</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"][vc_column_text el_class="medium-text"]
<ul>
 	<li>Even minor fender benders can result in pain and injury, and it is best to have every accident documented by the police in case of problems later on. It is required to call the police if damage from the accident exceeds a certain dollar figure ($1,500), and unless you are an expert in evaluating vehicle damage, medical bills, insurance and other associated costs, you may underestimate costs of the accident. It’s always a good idea to contact the police, even if the accident seems to be minor.</li>
 	<li>If you damage property and no other parties are involved, you have to make a good faith effort to contact the owner of that property to arrange restitution. For example, if you hit a parked car, you should try to locate the owner or leave your information on the vehicle.</li>
</ul>
[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text el_class="medium-text"]It should be noted that Illinois is an “at fault” state, which means drivers who are involved in car accidents who then seek compensation after the accident must prove the other party was at fault. If both parties are at fault, it has to be proven that the other party is <em>more</em> at fault than the person filing suit.

Further, there is a statute of limitations in Illinois. Personal injury lawsuits can be filed up to two years after an accident has occurred, and property damage lawsuits can be filed up to five years later. This time clock does not stop when a suit is filed, so it is important to act quickly as it can take a long time to proceed through a car accident case.
