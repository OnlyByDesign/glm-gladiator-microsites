<div class="question">
<h6>SHOULD I GET A PUBLIC DEFENDER?</h6>
</div>
<div class="answer">

If you can’t afford a private attorney, Illinois law states that a Public Defender will be appointed to provide legal representation in the areas of criminal, misdemeanor, juvenile justice, child protection, paternity, appeals, post-conviction and traffic cases.
Unfortunately, the public defense systems may not be capable of providing the defense you deserve.  According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in 2007, <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/clpdo07.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">about 73%</a> of county public defender offices exceeded the maximum recommended <a href="http://www.nlada.org/Defender/Defender_Standards/Standards_For_The_Defense#thirteentwelve" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">limit</a> of cases (150 felonies or 400 misdemeanors). Under pressure, public defenders may be quick to accept inadequate plea bargains and will not be able to devote the time and individual attention necessary to give you the best outcome possible and keep you out of jail.

</div></li>
 	<li>
<div class="question">
<h6>SHOULD I REPRESENT MYSELF?</h6>
</div>
<div class="answer">

Representing yourself in a criminal case is rarely a good idea. If you are even considering going <em>pro se,</em> look at the punishment you might face if convicted – the more severe the potential punishment, the more important it is that you are represented by counsel.
If you do represent yourself, be aware of the work involved.  You will have to properly fill out forms and attend hearings, meet all deadlines, know the laws, understand legal terminology and follow the rules of the court.  If you do go to trial, you will have to produce and examine witnesses and make opening and closing arguments in your defense. The consequences of making a mistake can ruin the rest of your life.

</div></li>
 	<li>
<div class="question">
<h6>WHAT MAKES A GOOD CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY?</h6>
</div>
<div class="answer">

An experienced DuPage County criminal defense lawyer will know the laws, the courts, the prosecutors and the judges, and how to examine the individual facts of your case and determine the best way to launch your defense. A good attorney will take care of paperwork, file everything properly and on time, and be capable of negotiating with the prosecutor and getting you the best deal possible. If your case does go to trial, a good attorney will find expert witnesses, and know how to present your case and how to advocate for your best interests in court. If your case doesn’t turn out in your favor, a good attorney will know how to file an appeal and get your sentence reduced. And a good criminal attorney should be someone you can relate to, who understands your situation and makes you feel relaxed and confident of achieving the best outcome of your case.

<h2>What Are Your Rights?</h2>
If you are arrested for a crime in Illinois, it’s important to know your rights so you can avoid making mistakes that may inadvertently lead to a conviction. You have the following rights:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Arrest warrant</strong> -- Anyone faced with a criminal arrest has a right to ask to be shown an arrest warrant and informed of what the criminal charges are. However, you can be arrested without a warrant if the police have probable cause.</li>
 	<li><strong>Miranda rights</strong> -- After being arrested, you should be read your Miranda rights informing you that you have the right to remain silent and not answer questions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Right to an attorney</strong> – You have the right to ask to consult with a lawyer before you say anything, as anything you do say can be held against you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Right to a preliminary hearing</strong> -- If the arrest is for a felony offense, any charges must be approved at a preliminary hearing by a judge or grand jury to authorize probable cause for the charges.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bond</strong> -- If probable cause is found, you have the right to a bond hearing to set an amount of bail which will allow you to remain out of custody until trial.</li>

<h2 class="textcenter">How Does the Court System Work?</h2>
<p class="textcenter">In Illinois, the following are the steps a criminal case will take as it progresses through the court system:</p>
<div class="steps-wrap">
<div class="single-step">
<span>1.</span>
<strong>Discovery</strong>
<p>The discovery phase allows your attorney the opportunity to review the prosecution’s evidence against you. This could include police reports, witness statements, videos or photos, physical evidence, or any other relevant information. Discovery can unfold gradually, and your attorney might not receive all the evidence until shortly before trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="single-step">
<span>2.</span>
<strong>Pre-trial Preparation</strong>
<p>During this phase, the defense attorney will begin locating and interviewing witnesses, developing a defense strategy, and securing evidence that may be presented at trial on your behalf.</p>
</div>
<div class="single-step">
<span>3.</span>
<strong>Plea Bargains</strong>
<p>At any point before a verdict, the defense attorney, defendant, and prosecution may enter into negotiations regarding a plea bargain. The terms of the plea bargain will vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances of the crime, criminal history, and the strength of the prosecution’s evidence.</p>
</div>
<div class="single-step">
<span>4.</span>
<strong>Trial</strong>
<p>If the case proceeds to trial, you can elect either a bench trial or a jury trial. The jury determines the outcome in a jury trial, whereas a judge makes the final decision regarding guilt or innocence in a bench trial. While both sides will present evidence at trial, it is the prosecution that bears the burden of proof. The state must prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
</div>
<div class="single-step">
<span>5.</span>
<strong>Verdict</strong>
<p>After the prosecution and defense present their closing arguments, either the judge or jury will deliberate and then issue a verdict. If the defendant is found not guilty, the case is over. If the defendant is found guilty, the case will proceed to the sentencing phase.</p>

<h2>Prosecuting Strategy</h2>
<p>The prosecutor has the burden to prove that you are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. To do this, the prosecutor will gather evidence against you, including police reports, witness statements, videos or photos, physical evidence, or any other relevant information. Prosecutors may negotiate with your attorney to see if they can come to a plea-bargaining agreement without having to go to trial. Terms of the plea bargain will depend on the specific circumstances of the crime, your criminal history, and the strength of the prosecution’s evidence.  If there is no agreement or the crime was particularly heinous and the evidence against you is strong, the prosecutor may decide to take the case to trial.</p>

<h4>Our DuPage County Criminal Lawyers’ Defense Strategy</h4>
<p>Your criminal defense attorney does not have to prove you are innocent, only that there is reasonable doubt that you committed the crime.  To do this, the defense attorney will gather evidence and interview you and any witnesses.</p>
<div class="strategy-list">
<p><strong>There will be a standard discovery procedure, where your attorney can:</strong></p>
<ul>
 	<li><p>Get copies of the arresting officers’ reports and statements made by prosecution witnesses</p></li>
        <li class="strat-list-amp"><span>&amp;</span></li>
 	<li><p>Review evidence against you that the prosecution proposes to introduce at trial.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="strat-rt-callout bg-dark-green-grid">
<p><strong>Based on the evidence,</strong> your DuPage criminal attorney may attempt to reach a plea-bargain agreement with the prosecutor or decide to take the case to trial. If the case goes to trial, you and your attorney can decide whether you want a bench trial in front of a judge or a jury trial. In either case, your attorney will have to come up with opening and closing arguments and present evidence to instill doubt that you committed the crime.</p>

<h2><b>Felony or Misdemeanor Offense?</b></h2>
</div>
<p>According to the <em><a href="http://www.ilga.gov/LEGISLATION/ILCS/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1876&amp;ChapAct=720%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B5%2F&amp;ChapterID=53&amp;ChapterName=CRIMINAL+OFFENSES&amp;ActName=Criminal+Code+of+1961." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Illinois Criminal Code</a></em>, crimes can be categorized as a misdemeanor or a felony, with felonies presenting the greatest threat to your life and liberty. Even an allegation of a felony offense can have a devastating effect on your reputation, livelihood and overall well being, and a conviction could lead to high fines and years of imprisonment.</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="column col_6">
<h3>Felony Offenses in Illinois</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/criminal-law/felonies/" rel="nofollow">Felony</a> crimes fall into five categories,</strong> while misdemeanors are broken into three classes, depending on seriousness. A conviction on a felony charge usually carries a jail sentence of more than one year. For the most serious violent felonies, the sentences are significantly more, and many offenses have mandatory minimum jail sentences.</p>
<p>In Illinois, there are several classes of felonies, and the severity of the class depends on the circumstances of the crime. For example, when it comes to drug possession, punishment depends on the type and amount of the drug. A class 4 felony can be punished with imprisonment of 1-3 years and fines of up to $25,000. Examples of class 4 felonies in Illinois include Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and possession of between 30.1 – 500.0 gm of marijuana.</p>
<p>A class 1 felony can be punished with imprisonment of 4-15 years and fines of up to $25,000. Examples of class 1 felonies in Illinois include kidnapping, sexual assault and drug possession of cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamine.</p>
<p>People convicted of felonies are sentenced to state or federal prison, and certain felonies are punishable by death. If a felony crime goes to federal court, the fines and time in prison for a conviction increase drastically. For example, a class A felony can be punished with possible life imprisonment and fines of up to $250,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="column col_6">
<h3>Misdemeanor Offenses in Illinois</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/criminal-law/misdemeanors/" rel="nofollow">Misdemeanor </a>criminal charges are</strong> those that have a maximum sentence of one year in jail or less, usually with no mandatory minimum jail time for most charges and can include fines of up to $2,500. Misdemeanor convictions will also affect your professional and personal life. If this is your second or greater offense, you are at increased risk for a jail sentence for many misdemeanor offenses in Illinois.</p>
