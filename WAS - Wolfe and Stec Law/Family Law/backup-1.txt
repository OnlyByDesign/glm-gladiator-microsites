<h2>Family Law Attorneys Serving DuPage &amp; Cook Counties</h2>
<p>Family law is complex and encompasses a range of issues, including marriage, divorce, child custody, adoption, paternity, and other matters related to the family structure. Family laws also address controversial issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage, and also criminal matters like domestic violence and child abuse. Illinois family laws may differ somewhat from those in other states. For example, in 2003 the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that a man who acknowledges paternity cannot reverse this later on the basis of DNA testing. And in 2013, the state legislature legalized same-sex marriage. Our experienced attorneys at Wolfe &amp; Stec know the system and can help you through the myriad laws dealing with family issues.</p>

<h2><b style="background-color:#F9F9F9;">Major Problems We Deal With Include...</b></h2>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="column col_6">
<h3>Divorce &amp; Separation in Illinois</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/family-law-attorneys/divorce/">Divorce</a>: Divorce is one of the most common family law issues.</strong> In Illinois, both fault and no-fault grounds are allowed; or you can base your divorce on the fact that you’ve been separated from your spouse for at least two years (six months if both parties agree). There is a residency requirement that at least one spouse must be a resident of Illinois for 90 days before filing for divorce. Property is divided by equitable division.</p>
<p>Even if a marriage ends amicably, you need legal guidance, as one small mistake could have serious consequences. Once a divorce decree is final, it cannot be changed, and you’re most likely stuck with its terms.</p>

<h3>Child Custody &amp; Support in Illinois</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/family-law-attorneys/child-custody/">Child Custody</a>: When it comes to the lives of your children</strong>, you want to come to an agreement that will provide the best possible outcome for their futures, but you also need to protect your financial well-being. Parents should never try to negotiate custody or support obligations without the help of experienced child custody lawyers. The laws and guidelines can be difficult to interpret, and making a mistake could mean returning to court and nasty drawn-out battles that adversely affect your children.</p>
<p>Illinois courts begin with a presumption that it’s best for a child to have frequent and continuing contact with both parents after a divorce. If possible, judges want to support joint custody arrangements. <a href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs4.asp?ActID=2086&amp;ChapterID=59&amp;SeqStart=8300000&amp;SeqEnd=10000000" target="new">Illinois Child Custody Laws</a> govern child custody decisions and procedures, including information about the availability of grandparents' visitation rights.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 15px;"><strong>Custody issues our Illinois family law attorneys handle with our clients include:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin: 0 0 40px 20px; list-style-type:square;">
 	<li><a href="/family-law-attorneys/child-support/">Child Support</a>: Illinois requires all parents to support their children. The amount of child support depends primarily on each parent’s income and other resources and how much time each parent spends with the children. <a href="http://www.alllaw.com/calculators/childsupport/illinois" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Here are some child support calculators to give you an idea of state guidelines.</a></li>
