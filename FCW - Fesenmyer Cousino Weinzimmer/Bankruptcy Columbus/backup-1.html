<h1>Columbus Bankruptcy Attorney</h1>
<h2>Is Debt Taking Over Your Financial Life?</h2>
As you become deeper and deeper in debt, you may wonder when the time comes to call a Columbus bankruptcy attorney. Being in debt can cause problems in all areas of your life, from being less productive at work to having money arguments at home that lead to divorce and family breakdown. Adding to the stress is the accompanying harassment by creditors and the fear of repossession of your property and foreclosure on your home. Often people in debt are already having financial difficulty and may then be hit with additional problems such as losing a job, facing uninsured medical expenses, or divorce.  Debts mount up, and harassment by creditors becomes overwhelming. If this is your situation, be aware that bankruptcy is a way to eliminate many debts and get a “fresh start” for individuals who are struggling with debts that have taken over their financial life.
<h2>Should You Call a Columbus Bankruptcy Lawyer</h2>
If you’re living in Franklin County or surrounding counties near Columbus, Ohio and you find yourself overwhelmed with debt, harassed by creditors, and considering bankruptcy as an option, what do you do? How do you even know if bankruptcy is right for you? Can you do it on your own, or should you have legal assistance?

Filing for bankruptcy yourself may save you money, but you need to do it properly as mistakes can cost far more than you save. Even if you do it yourself, there are fees for:
<ul>
 	<li>mandatory pre-filing credit counseling</li>
 	<li>court filing fees</li>
 	<li>mandatory debt management ‘education’</li>
 	<li>advice and information to help you decide whether to file</li>
 	<li>preparing your forms for filing, making the required number of copies, and assembling them in the proper order</li>
 	<li>other court procedures that may be required or beneficial.</li>
</ul>
In any case, it pays to consult with a bankruptcy attorney in Columbus, Ohio who knows the intricacies of the courts, the judges, and the system.

<h2>Know What Is Involved Before Filing Bankruptcy in Columbus</h2>
To start, you need to understand what bankruptcy is and know if you qualify. An experienced bankruptcy lawyer in Columbus can assist you in deciding if you qualify for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. If your average monthly income for the past six months is below the Ohio median for your size household, you meet the requirements (section 707(b)(2)) to qualify for Chapter 7.

Chapter 7 is the most common form of bankruptcy, and it will eliminate most or all debts, but you can use it only once every eight years. It’s quick — over in a few months, so you can begin rebuilding credit. There are exemptions (<a href="http://law.justia.com/codes/ohio/2016/title-23/chapter-2329/section-2329.66/" target="_blank" rel="noopener “nofollow”"> Exemption Laws of Ohio</a>) that can protect your property but it is advisable to consult with an attorney to confirm that your particular property is protected. Exemptions can include clothing, cars, equipment used for work (like tools) and household furnishings.

If you are not eligible for Chapter 7, filing for Chapter 13 is an option. Under <a href="/bankruptcy/chapter-13/" rel="“nofollow”">Chapter 13 bankruptcy</a>, you can consolidate payments to repay some or all of your debt affordably over a three- to five-year period. This plan is best for those who don’t qualify for Chapter 7, who want to keep an asset that they are behind on or have equity in an asset that they want to protect. Harassing calls and letters from creditors stop, and once you successfully complete the payment plan, qualifying debts covered by the plan are discharged.
<p style="line-height: 200%;">Be aware that exemption laws do not protect all property, a bankruptcy filing does not discharge all types of debts, and there are different classes of creditors that may be able to seize your property. The attorneys at Fesenmyer Cousino Weinzimmer understand each of these distinctions and can provide the best legal advice to protect your assets and provide financial freedom.</p>
